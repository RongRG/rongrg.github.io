[{"content":" What exactly are the LSTM layer, cell, neuron, unit? The number of units is the number of neurons in a layer. The number of units defines the dimension of the hidden states. The dimension of the cell state is the same as that of the hidden state. In the following, I will use $h$ for the length of hidden states \u0026ndash; the number of hidden units. It\u0026rsquo;s called hidden_size in PyTorch and num_units in Tensorflow.\nThe colah blog shows the core idea behind LSTMs nicely illustrating the 4 gates inside a LSTM neuron.\nFig. 1. LSTM neuron. (Image source: colah blog) When coding a LSTM model, how do we count the number of parameters in the matrix multiplication? A LSTM cell contains $h$ LSTM neurons.\nFig. 2. LSTM cell. (Image source: Raimi Karim) The 4 gates suggest that a LSTM has 4 feed-forward neural networks. If we have a sample input of feature size $i$, we concatenate the sample input with the hidden state and then pass them ($i+h$) together to the gates. The number of parameters in this LSTM is calculated as: $$ 4 \\times [h(h+i) + h] $$\nThis is the number of parameters in one LSTM cell, a.k.a. one LSTM layer.\n","permalink":"https://rongrg.github.io/posts/2023-02-10-lstm/","summary":"What exactly are the LSTM layer, cell, neuron, unit?

In a financial situation, investment risk can be identified with uncertain monetary loss. In a safety-critical engineering system, risk is the undesirable detrimental outcome.\nHow do we measure risk? Risk metrics typically involve probability distribution of outcomes and quantified loss for each outcome.\nThe standard deviation is a measure of uncertainty, but not a good choice for risk measure. Risk concerns only losses, but standard deviation can\u0026rsquo;t account for such asymmetric nature .\nArtzner et. al. (1998) provided an axiomatic definition that a risk measure should satisfy, which they call coherent risk measure. They denote the risk measure by the functional $\\rho(X)$, which assigns a real-valued number to a random variable $X$. $X$ can be thought of as payoffs or returns.\nMonotonicity: $\\rho(Y) \\leq \\rho(X)$ if $Y \\geq X$. Positive Homogeneity: $\\rho(0) = 0, \\rho(\\lambda X) = \\lambda \\rho(X)$ for all $X$ and all $\\lambda \u0026gt; 0$. Sub-additivity: $\\rho(X+Y) \\leq \\rho(X) + \\rho(Y)$ for all $X$ and $Y$. Translation invariance: $\\rho(X+Y) = \\rho(X) -C$ for all $X$ and $C \\in \\mathbb{R}$. The positive Homogeneity and sub-additivity imply that the functional is convex, $$ \\rho(\\lambda X+ (1-\\lambda)Y) \\leq \\rho(\\lambda X) + \\rho((1-\\lambda)Y) = \\lambda \\rho(X) + (1-\\lambda) \\rho(Y) $$ where $\\lambda \\in [0,1]$. This convexity property supports the diversification effect: The risk of a portfolio is no greater than the sum of the risks of its constituents.\nThe translation invariance shows the minimum amount of capital requirements to hedge the risk $\\rho(X)$, $\\rho(X+\\rho(X)) = 0$.\nValue at risk (VaR) Conditional value at risk (CVaR) A commonly used risk measure is the expected shortfall, also known as the conditional value at risk, i.e., CVaR.\nEntropic value at risk (EVaR) Risk-sensitive reinforcement learning References Distributional Reinforcement Learning for Risk-Sensitive Policies, Shiau Hong Lim and Ilyas Malik, NeurIPS 2022\n","permalink":"https://rongrg.github.io/posts/2022-11-11-riskrl/","summary":"What is risk?
